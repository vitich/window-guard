# 🛡️ Window Guard

**Window Guard** is a lightweight C-based X11 utility for Linux that automatically enforces strict window placement rules across multiple monitors.

## 📋 Features

- Keeps a specific window (e.g., `"Ticket Info"`) pinned to the **secondary monitor**
- The window title is specified in /etc/window-guard.conf
- Automatically moves **all other windows** back to the **primary monitor**
- Cancels maximized/tiled states to allow repositioning
- Locks the mouse cursor within the primary monitor bounds
- Logs all window movements for visibility and debugging
- Compatible with **most X11 window managers** (e.g. MATE, XFCE, Openbox, Fluxbox, i3, etc.)

> ⚠️ **GNOME X11** may not fully respect movement requests. Window repositioning in GNOME can be inconsistent due to how `mutter` handles client requests. Use with caution.
